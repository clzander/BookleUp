This is the project from Cl.... Za.... (MtrNr.: 57...5)
Since I don't want my full name and matriculation number in a Mircosoft service, I've shortened them :D

# BookleUp
"BookleUp" is my little online bookstore that has to be implemented in a frontend development course at university.

## Description
As I said, the project is a small webshop for buying books. It will be developed using React and TypeScript in the frontend, as well as some other libraries like ReactRouter for CSR and at least one library for styling, but I haven't decided yet what I will use. The shop will definitely need some state management, so Redux and Contexts are at our service.

We won't be developing the backend, instead we'll be using the [bookmonkey api](https://github.com/workshops-de/bookmonkey-api), which has typical CRUD operations for both books and users. Since the focus of this course is on the frontend, this makes things a bit easier.
